a ruby .ods parser and writer

this is a currently non-functioning parser and writer for OpenDocument Spreadsheet files written in Ruby, in active development.

the code in sample.rb represents a set of behaviors I'd like to have, the details of which having not yet been implemented. it is made partly in response to the lack of features (and a clean, simple interface that hides the details of having to specify every goddamn cell you want to manipulate) in many other spreadsheet writers. the initial aim is to be able to create a complete spreadsheet from a dataset that conforms to x, y and z in a few steps, in a way that I would want to create a spreadsheet 99% of the time.
